ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender
Description
The Movie Recommender is a web-based application designed to help users find movies tailored to their preferences. By selecting their current mood, desired pace, and whether the movie should be family-friendly, users receive personalized recommendations. The app uses a backend server to fetch movie data and provides detailed information for each movie, including where to watch and a trailer link.
